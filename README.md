# 2048 Game
This project brings the classic 2048 game to life using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game is set on a 4x4 grid where players can slide numbered tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with their combined value. The objective is to strategically move the tiles to create a tile with the number 2048, all while maximizing your score and preventing the grid from filling up entirely.

The interface is designed to be visually appealing, with dynamic color changes that correspond to different tile values, enhancing the overall user experience. A real-time score display keeps players informed of their progress as they play. When the game ends, whether by achieving the 2048 tile or running out of possible moves, a clear game-over message is displayed along with the final score. This project not only offers an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience but also showcases practical skills in Python programming, GUI development, and game logic.
